#+title: Support for Project Maintenance
#+setupfile: ../doc/internal/links.org

The files in this directory support the maintenance of the project. You can
safely ignore this directory if you only want to use the project.

There are two scripts in this directory.

- =arduino-upgrade=
- =docs-generate=

They are designed to be called with no arguments, and can be called from any
working directory, though they both modify the source code in place.

=arduino-upgrade= updates the indices in [[../nix/arduino][../nix/arduino]].

=docs-generate= will execute any ~SRC~ blocks in Org-mode files, modifying them
in place. And then it generates GitHub Flavored Markdown files from them.
